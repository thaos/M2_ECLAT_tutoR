    "The aim of this course is to provide a basic introduction to R. This takes the forms of little exercices to solve on your own. The idea is not to memorize all the R commands but to be able to find and use the information in the R base cheatsheet provided. For those familiar with Python or Matlab, there is also a cheatsheet giving the correspondence between the commands of those programming language.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, this crash course mainly consists of few exercices to make you use the cheatsheets and R.\n",

    "The exercises are divided into the following parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 - the main data structures in R. \n",

    "2 - some control flow tools\n",
